                About me
            </h2>

            <p>
                I am a third year computer science student at the University of Witswatersrand. 
                I am eager to learn about web development and everything that it would entail to give me a very good foundation into the real world which includes learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                I find working with web development fascinating and a fun skill to have in the world of IT. 

            </p>

            <p>
                I have experience in coding C++, python and java but I am always on the hunt to expand my knowledge and learn new coding languages and evolve my current coding techniques. I am looking at joining the cyber-security team because I have a great interest in it and I believe it is a great field to specialise in.

                Latest Project
            </h3>

            <p>
                In second year of varsity I worked on a mobile computing project that required me to make an application for a food delivery service. The project was both difficult but fun, it was difficult to code all the different interfaces and the data behind all the buttons. We also had to work with PHP and SQL to build a database to store information. It was a rewarding feeling to test the app and admire what my teem and I had built.
